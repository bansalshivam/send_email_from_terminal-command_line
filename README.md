# send_email_from_terminal-command_line
This repository contains scrpit for sending the emails
directly from the terminal/command-line.

You need few things to run the script
1. Python3 or above in your system
2. Stable internet connection.
3. Firefox browser
4. Geckodriver

Selenium is a differntly design module and
you need a geckodriver to operate firefox browser.

There are lot of third party modules that are
used in the script and it is suggested to run 
the script in virtual env.

NOTE: I used yahoo.com to send emails in this script
It may not work for other mailing platforms like gmail.

The two scripts are uploaded:
1. login.py (
        https://github.com/bansalshivam/send_email_from_terminal-command_line/blob/master/login.py
            ) 

2. emails.py(
        https://github.com/bansalshivam/send_email_from_terminal-command_line/blob/master/emails.py
            )

The first script login.py can only be 
used to login into yahoo account

The second script emails.py is the main
code to send emails.
