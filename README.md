# send_email_from_terminal-command_line
This repository contains scrpit for sending the emails
directly from the terminal/command-line.

You need two major things to run the script
1. Python3 or above in your system
2. Stable internet connection.

There are lot of third party modules that are
used in the script and it is suggested to run 
the script in virtual env.

NOTE: I used yahoo.com to send emails in this script
It may not work for other mailing platforms like gmail.

The two scripts are uploaded:
1. login.py (
        send_email_from_terminal-command_line/login.py
            ) 

2. emails.py(
        send_email_from_terminal-command_line/emails.py
            )

The first script login.py can only be 
used to login into yahoo account

The second script emails.py is the main
code to send emails.
